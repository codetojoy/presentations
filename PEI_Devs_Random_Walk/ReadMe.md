# Executive Summary

The following are some notes that may help those who attended the talk. They are less likely to be useful to those who couldn't attend (apologies).

## Identify the gig (was *Identify Terrain*)

* There are differences between a standard tech talk, a lightning talk, a "dry run", a company "lunch and learn", a conference talk, a keynote (!!!) and so on.
* Every organization (PEI Devs, CIPS PEI, Maritime Dev Con, your company) will have different characteristics. e.g. CIPS is more formal than PEI Devs, and a different audience.
* Is the audience composed of coders, or a mix of IT Managers, Sys Admins, etc?
* Consider informal vs formal re: prepration time, post-talk artifacts, etc.

## Set Expectations/Parameters (was *Plan Your Journey*)

* Write the summary/abstract first. It's your chance to set the expectations/parameters of the talk.
* Language matters:
    * Is your talk informal? a funny rant? a creative flight of fancy? Communicate that in the summary.
    * I use "executive summary" to enforce an overview of a topic (as opposed to a training session).
    * For this talk, I used "random walk" and "informal" to set the tone.
    * Be sure to state pre-requisites for the audience. e.g. For a talk on Groovy, state that a working knowledge of Java is expected.
* Plan a story
    * For PEI Devs, it could be as simple as: 
        * (a) I was curious about language X.
        * (b) I downloaded it and studied it. 
        * (c) Here's what I learned. 
    * Note *three* acts!
* Time & Artifacts
    * Consider how much effort you want to put into images, code examples, slide transitions, and so on. (The type of gig will influence this.)

## Form An Opinion (was **Be Bold**)

* As an observer, what techniques do you like? dislike?
* Know that there is an entire catalogue of Presentation Patterns (see Resources)
* Example patterns: Narrative Arc, Triad, Cave Painting, Lightsaber
* Example anti-patterns: Laser Weapon (!), Ant Font, Photo Maniac, Bullet-Ridden Corpse
* Just as we aspire to write code *with no if statements*, consider building slides with *no bullet points*.
* Have an opinion, but be flexible in listening/incorporating feedback.
* My own opinions (YMMV):
    * I aim to be enthusiastic, loud (in the theatre sense), with an interesting narrative.
    * I prioritize those that attend the talk. e.g. For a company "lunch-and-learn", I despise conference calls, as it distracts everyone. I'd rather visit each office individually.
    * For informal talks, I don't spend time on slides for post-talk viewing. I told a story around the campfire: you had to be there.
    * I *do* post code examples in a well-documented GitHub repo (for post-talk viewing). I don't try to put code into presentation software: I simply *break-out* of the slides into an editor. 
    * I've observed that excellent talks draw an analogy from another discipline, such as art history, music, math, and so on. The parallel info is inherently interesting to the audience, and if the analogy is apt, then it can make a compelling argument. As an example, in the early 2000s, against the heavy, ornate weight of Web Services, a simple, fresh solution emerged: REST. An analogy might be the rock music scene in the late 1980s, and [this album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevermind).  

## Other Tips

* As an observer, pay attention to the presentation dimension of a talk. You'll discover lots of tricks.
* Most speakers practice their talks, **aloud**, many times. It's important for timing, knowing the material, and managing nervousness.
* Use a stopwatch during practice and during the talk. Identify temporal milestones.
* If you are running out of time, with lots of material, **don't** speed through the slides to get to the end. You're not receiving a grade on the # of slides presented. Skip slides discreetly, and generalize your points into an elegant take-away message.
* Buy a remote clicker/laser pointer. 
* It's always scary to speak in public, but it does get easier with experience. Consider a public speaking class, such as ToastMasters. Take a class in acting, or improv theatre.
* For a talk, contact the organizers about A/V stuff so that no one is surprised.
* Consider having a copy of your talk available online, or on a USB drive. Prepare for disaster.
* *Canned* demos can be useful. Run the code beforehand and capture the output, as on a TV cooking show.
* Ask a friend to give constructive criticism on your performance.
* For formal talks, give a "dry-run" of the talk at a less formal venue. You could give a company lunch talk before presenting for PEI Devs. Or possibly a dry-run for PEI Devs before Maritime Dev Con. You'll get useful feedback and reach more people to boot.

## Lessons Learned

* Early on, I gave a talk without preparing for time. Naturally, I had way too much material.
* I've given code-heavy talks to a group that weren't really coders. Uncomfortable.
* At a 45-minute lunch-n-learn with elite coders, I opened with a 10 minute, artsy history of an existing tool, prior to the main topic. *Bad* idea. They wanted a quick intro and code examples. In this case, *code is gold*. 
* Nothing is more nerve-wracking than an A/V issue before a presentation. Do all you can to prepare for this.

## The Skinny

Presenting a tech talk can be intimidating, but it's a true growth experience. PEI Devs needs more speakers to be sustainable, so please submit your talk idea. The good news: our group is the *perfect* training ground. Talks can be informal or formal, and the people in the group are wonderful. Your audience is a bunch of friendly, sharp geeks who want to hear your story.
